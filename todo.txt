Things to measure
    Primary:
    position of seat
        line graph with data markers, center point is "0" mark
    
    Speed of seat:
        graph? (not sure exactly how to measure it)
    
    Strength/force of pull
        bar graph? each bar is the strength of the pull

    speed of boat
        line graph
    
    Secondary:
    force of leg push?
        bar graph?
